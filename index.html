            <p>Ever wanted to artificially inflate spacetime inside a localised boundary and create micro solar systems you can harvest for energy and resources? No? Um, anyway.
               Introducing the Eye of Harmony, a new multi-block with 27 tiered blocks which will gate entrance into UXV tier. This multi-block works by taking a dimensions ore weights, multiplying them up by some factor dependent on recipe tier and then automatically processing the ores into dust form.
               I.e. 1 Magnetite Ore -> 2 Crushed Magnetite + 0.1 Iron Dust -> (2 Purified Crushed Magnetite + 2/9 Iron Dust) + 0.1 Iron Dust -> Thermal Centrifuged Magnetite + (2/9 + 0.1) Iron Dust + 2/9 Gold Dust -> 2 Magnetite Dust + (2/9 + 0.1) Iron Dust + (2/9 + 0.2) Gold Dust -> (2/9 + 0.1 + 2) Iron dust + (2/9 + 0.2) Gold Dust -> 2.32 Iron Dust + 0.42 Gold Dust.
               Tldr therefore 1 Magnetite Ore -> 2.32 Iron Dust + 0.42 Gold Dust.
               This is a direct conversion and is cached during game load as to prevent unnecessary recipe checks causing excess lag.
               In addition to this the materials outputted will have a plasma equivalent as an output dependent on the planetary tier. I.e. if Sulfur appears in a tier 9 recipe, then you will get 9,000,000L of Sulfur.
               Depending on the tier of recipe run you will either gain White dwarf matter, Black dwarf matter or Universium. These will then be combined into a final UXV-tier material called Magnetohydrodynamically constrained star matter, the plasma for which you will obtain via the EOH. Expect stargate nerfs to follow.
               This multi has not had much play-testing so please try to break it and report issues. Balance may still be off and need adjusting, both in EOH recipes for the multi itself and the recipes run within it. Thanks!</p>
